Architecture: all
Depends: python (>= 2.7), strace
Description: Memoizes execution of build commands.
 Buildcache uses strace to see which files are read and written
 during the build step.
 A build is identified by the SHA1 of the executable, its
 arguments, and filtered environment variables. After the build is
 run, buildcache takes the md5sum of the files that were read (the
 "footprint" of the build) and caches a copy of the files that were
 written.
 If a previous build exists, and the md5sum of the footprint of the
 previous build matches the current contents of the footprint
 files, the cached output is restored and used instead of
 re-running the build command.
